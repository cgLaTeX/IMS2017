\begin{abstract}
Here we consider a disordered system of interacting quantum dots---nanoscale semiconductors with wide applicability in systems ranging from lasing to quantum computing to biological contrast imaging and next-generation displays.
Quantum dots facilitate absorptive and emissive processes at specific frequencies over timescales independent of those in the incident radiation; by treating the system \emph{semiclassically} we maintain the discrete dynamics inherent to quantum objects without resorting to second quantization to describe electromagnetic fields (i.e.\ fields behave classically).
Our solution to the coupled system proceeds via
  \begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
  \item determination of source wavefunctions through evolution of the differential Liouville equations, and \label{enum:step 1}
  \item evaluation of radiation patterns through well-known computational electromagnetics techniques. \label{enum:step 2}
  \end{inparaenum}
We employ a highly-tuned predictor-corrector integration scheme to advance the source wavefunctions in time; the subsequent polarizations that arise then serve as point-like sources within time domain integral equations electromagnetic integral equations that is used to propagate the field.
The coupled solution of (1) and (2) produces a complete description of both the quantum and electromagnetic dynamics at each timestep giving rise to lasing effects, non-linear propagation, coupled Rabi oscillations, and other optical phenomena.
This paper presents the theory, computational framework, and selected interesting physical observations for several such systems.

\section{Introduction}
Conventional models of electromagnetic systems give rise to interesting phenomena through prescription of static boundary conditions.
While these boundary conditions sufficiently describe passive scattering within systems, they fail to account for richer behavior in systems with dynamics.
Such behaviors have proven essential in countless technological applications motivating the need for an efficient fullwave Maxwell solver that couples to an underlying description of the system behavior.

\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{The quantum Liouville-von Neumann equation}
We wish to model the behavior of $N$ interacting quantum dots immersed in a homogeneous background medium amidst monochromatic radiation of frequency $\omega_L$. Due to the band limit of the incident radiation, we approximate each quantum dot as a two-level system with transition frequency $\omega_0 \approx \omega_L$.
As such, a density matrix formulation fully describes the time-evolution of the population in each level as well as the coherences between levels that give rise to radiation physics.

The density matrix for a quantum dot, $\hat{\rho}$, evolves according to the Liouville-von Neumann equation
\begin{equation}
  i \hbar \pdv{\hat{\rho}}{t} = \commutator{\hat{\mathcal{H}}(t)}{\hat{\rho}} - \hat{\mathcal{D}}\qty[\hat{\rho}]
  \label{eq:liouville}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mathcal{H}}$ and $\hat{\mathcal{D}}$ denote the quantum dot's Hamiltonian and dissipator operators, respectively\cite{Breuer2002}.
Here, $\hat{\mathcal{H}}(t)$ describes the  two-level structure of the dot as well as an explicit coupling to an external electric field.
In contrast $\hat{\mathcal{D}}$ models the aggregate effect of processes that destroy coherences and relax populations in the quantum dot system (such as spontaneous emission or phonon losses) through assumed interactions with an external environment.
As matrices,
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \hat{\mathcal{H}}(t) &\equiv \mqty(0 & \hbar \chi(t) \\ \hbar \chi^*(t) & \hbar \omega_0) \label{eq:hamiltonian} \\
    \hat{\mathcal{D}}[\hat{\rho}] &\equiv \mqty((\rho_{00} + 1)/T_2 & \rho_{01}/T_1 \\ \rho_{10}/T_1 & \rho_{11}/T_2) \label{eq:dissipator}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\chi(t) \equiv \vb{d} \cdot \vb{E}/\hbar$, $\vb{d} \equiv \matrixel{0}{\hat{\vb{d}}}{1}$, $\hat{\vb{d}}$ represents the dipole moment operator $\hat{\vb{d}} \equiv -e \hat{\vb{r}}$, and $T_{1,2}$ denote characteristic relaxation times (determined empirically).
Physically, $\chi(t)$ should contain $\hat{\vb{E}}$ as an \emph{operator} to couple the quantum dot to a quantized electric field of photons; by considering systems with a sufficiently high field intensity so as to ignore single-photon effects, however, we instead treat $\vb{E}$ as a classical object arising from conventional electromagnetic source distributions in a manner consistent with the semiclassical nature of our approach.

\subsection{Determination of electric fields}

The evolution of \cref{eq:liouville} necessarily produces radiation as the quantum dot absorbs and re-radiates light.
Using the density matrix formulation detailed above, we may define a classical polarization as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \vb{P}(\vb{r}, t) &\equiv \sum_i \Tr[\hat{\vb{d}}_i \hat{\rho}_i(t)] \delta(\vb{r} - \vb{r}_i) \\
                      &\equiv \sum_i 2 \vb{d}_i \Re\!\qty[\rho_{01}^{(i)}(t)] \delta(\vb{r} - \vb{r}_i)
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:polarization}
\end{equation}
for a set of dots each having a location $\vb{r}_i$, dipole moment $\vb{d}_i$, and off-diagonal matrix element $\rho_{01}^{(i)}(t)$.
From this we may compute the electric field at any other point in space via the the electric dyadic Green's function\cite{Rothwell2008}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{gathered}
    \vb{E}(\vb{r}, t) = \vb{E}_0(\vb{r}, t) - \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int
      \qty(I - 3\bar{\vb{r}}\bar{\vb{r}}) \frac{c^2 \vb{P}(\vb{r}', t_R)}{\abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}^3} + \\
      \qty(I - 3\bar{\vb{r}}\bar{\vb{r}}) \frac{c \dot{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}', t_R)}{\abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}^2} +
      \qty(I -  \bar{\vb{r}}\bar{\vb{r}}) \frac{\ddot{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}', t_R)}{\abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}} \dd[3]{\vb{r}'}
  \end{gathered}
  \label{eq:efield}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{\vb{r}} \equiv \vb{r} - \vb{r}'/\abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}$ and $t_R \equiv t - \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}/c$.
These fields serve to couple the dynamics of each quantum dot through the definition of $\chi(t)$ in \cref{eq:hamiltonian}.
Through this coupling \cref{eq:liouville} becomes highly non-linear as $\hat{\rho}_j$ depends on itself arbitrarily far into the past.



\section{Solution Methodology}
\subsection{Discretization and time-evolution}

To solve both \cref{eq:liouville,eq:efield} simultaneously we must first choose an appropriate discretization for $\hat{\rho}$ in both space and time.
As the physical dimensions of these nanostructures remain negligible when compared to the wavelengths present in radiated fields, $\vb{E}(\vb{r}, t)$ varies little throughout the volume occupied by a dot thus we may approximate each as a $\delta$-function in space.
To represent the temporal part of $\hat{\rho}$ we make use of an interpolatory set of Lagrange polynomials.
Such a set has two advantages: it easily accounts for non-integer delay times in $t_R$ by interpolating $\vb{P}(\vb{r}, t)$ between timepoints and it facilitates straightforward evaluation of the polarization derivatives in \cref{eq:efield}.

This discretization, then, suggests a straightforward solution methodology to solve this non-linear equation in two iterated steps; (a) we first use \cref{eq:efield} to evaluate $\vb{E}(\vb{r}, t)$ from a given source distribution at the location of each dot and (b ) then step \cref{eq:rotating liouville} forward in time to update the source distribution.
The first step---evaluating \cref{eq:efield}---proceeds straightforwardly save for pre-calculating the spatial terms and interpolation weights at the start of the simulation.
Numerically integrating \cref{eq:liouville}, however, requires some care.
For this, we make use of a highly-tuned predictor/corrector ($PE(CE)^m$) algorithm detailed in \cite{Glaser2009}.
By approximating the solution to the differential equation as a weighted set of (complex) exponentials we recover the oscillating and decaying modes in $\hat{\rho}(t)$ with a high degree of accuracy without incurring a significant penalty in the size of our timestep $\Delta t$.
Moreover, repeated iterations of the corrector-evaluator step ($CE^m$) facilitate mutual interactions of quantum dots within one timestep; as a result, the timestep becomes unconstrained by delay between quantum dots and we need only consider the frequencies in the system in choosing $\Delta t$.
%The limitation on $\Delta t$ arises due to the non-linear differential equation, wherein one needs to make sure that $\delta t$ is chosen such that $R_{min}> c \Delta t$.
%This ensures a self consistent solution to the non-linear system.
%However, this constraint results excessive number of time steps.

\subsection{The rotating-wave approximation}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/frame_comparison.tex}
  \caption{\label{fig:frame comparison}
    Comparison of $\rho_{00}(t)$ using both fixed and rotating reference frames for interacting quantum dots.
    Both frames produce largely the same trajectory, however the inset spy reveals the fixed frame contains a minute oscilliatory term that the rotating frame does not.
  }
\end{figure}

%In single-dot system where one seeks to describe $\hat{\rho}(t)$ in response to an incident pulse, this computational bottleneck is overcome by using a rotating wave approximation.
%When one is aggregating response due to multiple interactions, the computational infrastructure is more complex.
\Cref{eq:liouville,eq:efield} sufficiently detail the physics of semiclassical radiation processes in quantum dot systems, however the nature of \cref{eq:liouville} imposes a significant computational bottleneck on na\"ive implementations.
For the systems under consideration here, $\omega_0 \sim \SI{1500}{\milli\eV}/\hbar$ and we must resolve our system on such a timescale.
By expanding the commutator in \cref{eq:liouville} for $\chi(t) \in \real$,
\begin{equation}
  \commutator{\hat{\mathcal{H}}}{\hat{\rho}} =
  \mqty(
    -2 i \chi \Im[\rho_{01}] & \chi\qty(1 - 2 \rho_{00}) - \omega_0 \rho_{01} \\
    \omega_0 \rho_{01}^* - \chi\qty(1 - 2\rho_{00}) & 2 i \chi \Im[\rho_{01}]
  ),
\end{equation}
it becomes apparent that the terms contributing to radiation physics, $\rho_{00}$ and $\rho_{11}$, contain only terms proportional to $\chi(t)$.
To have $\chi(t)$ approximately equal to $\omega_0$ would require an incident electric field roughly as strong as that used to bind a quantum dot together.
In such a regime the stability of the nanostructures becomes questionable, let alone the nature of energy transitions, so we may safely choose $\chi(t) \ll \omega_0$.


Introducing a time-dependent unitary transformation, $\hat{\rho}_\text{rot} = \hat{U}\hat{\rho}\hat{U}^\dagger$, where
\begin{equation}
  \hat{U} = \mqty(\dmat{1, e^{i \omega_L t}}),
  \label{eq:unitary transformation}
\end{equation}
we may write a rotating version of \cref{eq:liouville} as
\begin{equation}
  i \hbar \pdv{\hat{\rho}_\text{rot}}{t} = \commutator{\hat{U} \hat{\mathcal{H}} \hat{U}^\dagger - \hat{U} \, \partial_t \hat{U}^\dagger}{\hat{\rho}_\text{rot}} - \hat{\mathcal{D}}[\hat{\rho}_\text{rot}].
  \label{eq:rotating liouville}
\end{equation}
with $\hat{U} \hat{\mathcal{H}} \hat{U}^\dagger - \hat{U} \, \partial_t \hat{U}^\dagger \equiv \hat{\mathcal{H}}_\text{rot}$.
As $\chi(t) \sim \cos(\omega_L t)$, the matrix elements in \cref{eq:rotating liouville} will contain frequencies proportional to $\omega_0 \pm \omega_L$.
As $\omega_0 \approx \omega_L$, the high-frequency terms will approximately integrate to zero over any appreciable timescale and we may safely ignore them, instead considering only the envelope function of $\chi(t)$. This forms the basis of the so-called Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA)\cite{Allen1987}.

  \caption{\label{fig:screening} Screening effect in a two-dot system.
    For the same incident pulse, quantum dots nearby each other experience very little excitation.

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:frame comparison} details the trajectory of a quantum dot in an $n=32$ particle simulation under the effects of an external ``$\pi$-pulse'' (a pulse constructed to rotate a wavefunction by $\pi$ radians on the Bloch sphere) in fixed and rotating reference frames.
The fixed-frame solution contains a very small, very high-frequency oscillating term that the rotating frame does not; on timescales significant to the evolution of $\rho_{00}$ (and thus the radiation dynamics) this oscillation all but completely vanishes which facilitates a rotating-frame solution in 160 timesteps (compared with a fixed-frame solution in 59959).

\Cref{fig:echo} shows the results of a two-pulse experiment.
Two pulses delayed by $\tau$ strike a collection of 64 nearly resonant quantum dots.
As each dot has a slightly different value of $\omega_0$, the initial pulse dephases the system by evolving the $\hat{\rho}$ at slightly different rates.
The second pulse, carefully constructed to undo the dephasing, results in an experimentally detectable flash at time $t = 2\tau$.

Finally, \cref{fig:decoherence} depicts the population distribution for $128$ homogeneous quantum dots after exposure to a variety of incident pulses.
The integrated pulse angle (analogus to the $\pi$-pulse mentioned earlier) measures the intensity of the incident light.
As each quantum dot absorbs and emits radiation, some dots feel a stronger field than others and therefore excite more than others which leads to the broadening of the population distribution in each column.
Without interactions, each dot would excite by exactly the same amount and the population curve in \cref{fig:decoherence} would follow a cosine.
Additionally, \cref{fig:screening} gives some explanation of the extreme outliers that appear in several of the columns in \cref{fig:decoherence}.
A system evolved with two dots very close to each other has very little change in the overall population though the effect diminishes rapidly with distance.
The outliers in \cref{fig:decoherence} have a small separaration relative to the rest of the distribution, thus they see an efffect similar to that of \cref{fig:screening} (though we note the effect becomes much more complex than simply screening an external field for many-body systems).


\section{Conclusions}
Here we have developed the tools required for a simulation of optically-active quantum dots.
In describing the coupling between particles, a semiclassical formulation allows us to treat fields as classical objects thereby reducing the complexity of the simulation while simultaneously offering a highly accurate integral equation methodology for propagating radiation throughout the system.
Additionally, a global rotating-wave approximation \emph{dramatically} reduces the frequency content of the systems under consideration which allows for timesteps several orders of magnitude larger than those available in a fixed-frame model.
We have shown the numerical validity of such an approximation as well as several features of results obtained with our model for moderate assemblages of dots.
In the near future, we hope to expand our research efforts in this area to include accelerated computational techniques---such as an Adaptive Integral\cite{Bleszynski1996} or Fast Multipole method\cite{Greengard1987}---for rotating-frame systems as well as phenomena arising from disorder (such as Anderson localization and pulse fragmentation effects).
