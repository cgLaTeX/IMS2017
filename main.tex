\begin{abstract}
Conventional models of electromagnetic systems give rise to interesting phenomena through prescription of static boundary conditions.
  While these boundary conditions sufficiently describe passive scattering within systems, they fail to account for richer behavior in systems with dynamics.
  Such processes have proven essential in countless technological applications motivating the need for an efficient full-wave Maxwell solver that couples to an underlying description of the system behavior.

  Here we consider a disordered system of interacting quantum dots---nanoscale semiconductors with wide applicability in systems ranging from lasing to quantum computing to biological contrast imaging and next-generation displays.
  Much like atoms, individual quantum dots facilitate absorptive and emissive processes at specific frequencies over timescales independent of those in the incident radiation.
  These processes couple between dots due to the presence of electromagnetic fields, giving rise to emergent nonlinear behavior within the system.
  By treating quantum dots \emph{semiclassically} within our simulation, we maintain the discrete dynamics inherent to quantum objects without resorting to second quantization to describe electromagnetic fields (i.e.\ fields behave classically).
  This has the advantage of partitioning the simulation into two distinct parts,
  \begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
  \item determination of source wavefunctions through evolution of the differential Liouville equations, and \label{enum:step 1}
  \item evaluation of radiation patterns through well-known computational electromagnetics techniques. \label{enum:step 2}
  \end{inparaenum}
  We employ a highly-tuned predictor-corrector integration scheme to advance the source wavefunctions in time; the subsequent polarizations that arise then serve as point-like sources to electromagnetic integral equations (chosen to facilitate accurate point-to-point communication of fields without the computational overhead of a ``radiation grid'').
  The coupled solution of \cref{enum:step 1} and \cref{enum:step 2}, then, produces a complete description of both the quantum and electromagnetic dynamics at each timestep, giving rise to lasing effects, non-linear propagation, coupled Rabi oscillations, and other optical phenomena.

\section{Introduction}


\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{The quantum Liouville-von Neumann equation}
We wish to model the behavior of $N$ interacting quantum dots immersed in a homogeneous background medium amidst monochromatic radiation of frequency $\omega_L$.
Due to the bandlimitedness of the incident radiation, we approximate each quantum dot as a two-level system with transition frequency $\omega_0 \approx \omega_L$; as such, a density matrix formulation fully describes the time-evolution of each level population as well as the coherences between levels that give rise to radiation physics.

The density matrix for a quantum dot, $\hat{\rho}$, evolves according to the Liouville-von Neumann equation
\begin{equation}
  i \hbar \pdv{\hat{\rho}}{t} = \commutator{\hat{\mathcal{H}}(t)}{\hat{\rho}} - \hat{\mathcal{D}}\qty[\hat{\rho}]
  \label{eq:liouville}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mathcal{H}}$ and $\hat{\mathcal{D}}$ denote the quantum dot's Hamiltonian and dissipator operators {\it cite Breuer, Heinz-Peter, and Francesco Petruccione. The theory of open quantum systems. Oxford University Press on Demand, 2002.}, respectively.
Here, $\hat{\mathcal{H}}(t)$ describes the  two-level structure of the dot as well as an explicit coupling to an external electric field.
In contrast $\hat{\mathcal{D}}$ models the aggregate effect of processes that destroy coherences and relax populations in the quantum dot system through assumed interactions with an external environment (such as spontaneous emission or phonon losses).
As matrices,
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \hat{\mathcal{H}}(t) &\equiv \mqty(0 & \hbar \chi(t) \\ \hbar \chi^*(t) & \hbar \omega_0) \label{eq:hamiltonian} \\
    \hat{\mathcal{D}}[\hat{\rho}] &\equiv \mqty((\rho_{00} + 1)/T_2 & \rho_{01}/T_1 \\ \rho_{10}/T_1 & \rho_{11}/T_2). \label{eq:dissipator}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\chi(t) \equiv \vb{d} \cdot \vb{E}/\hbar$, $\vb{d} \equiv \matrixel{0}{\hat{\vb{d}}}{1}$, and $\hat{\vb{d}}$ represents the dipole moment operator $\hat{\vb{d}} \equiv -e \hat{\vb{r}}$. 
Physically, $\chi(t)$ should contain $\hat{\vb{E}}$ as an \emph{operator} to couple the quantum dot to a quantized electric field of photons.
By considering systems with a sufficiently high field intensity so as to ignore single-photon effects, however, we instead treat $\vb{E}$ as a classical object arising from conventional electromagnetic source distributions, consistently with the semiclassical nature of our approach.

In the systems we wish to investigate, $\omega_0 \gg \chi(t)$. By expanding the commutator in \cref{eq:liouville} for $\chi(t) \in \real$,
\begin{equation}
  \commutator{\hat{\mathcal{H}}}{\hat{\rho}} =
  \mqty(
    -2 i \chi \Im[\rho_{01}] & \chi\qty(1 - 2 \rho_{00}) - \omega_0 \rho_{01} \\ 
    \omega_0 \rho_{01}^* - \chi\qty(1 - 2\rho_{00}) & 2 i \chi \Im[\rho_{01}]
  ),
\end{equation}
it becomes apparent $\rho_{00}$ contains only low-frequency terms proportional to $\chi(t)$ while $\rho_{01}$ varies much more quickly due to the dependence on $\omega_0$.
By introducing a time-dependent unitary transformation $\hat{\rho}_\text{rot} = \hat{U}\hat{\rho}\hat{U}^\dagger$ where
\begin{equation}
  \hat{U} = \mqty(\dmat{1, e^{i \omega_L t}}), 
  \label{eq:unitary transformation}
\end{equation}
we may write a rotating version of \cref{eq:liouville} as
\begin{equation}
  i \hbar \pdv{\hat{\rho}_\text{rot}}{t} = \commutator{\hat{U} \hat{\mathcal{H}} \hat{U}^\dagger - \hat{U} \, \partial_t \hat{U}^\dagger}{\hat{\rho}_\text{rot}} - \hat{\mathcal{D}}[\hat{\rho}_\text{rot}].
  \label{eq:rotating liouville}
\end{equation}
Defining $\hat{\mathcal{H}}_\text{rot} \equiv \hat{U} \hat{\mathcal{H}} \hat{U}^\dagger - \hat{U} \, \partial_t \hat{U}^\dagger$ as the rotating-frame Hamiltonian and assuming $\chi(t) \sim \cos(\omega_L t)$, the matrix elements in \cref{eq:rotating liouville} will contain frequencies proportional to $\omega_0 \pm \omega_L$.
As $\omega_0 \approx \omega_L$, the high-frequency terms will approximately integrate to zero over any appreciable timescale and we may safely ignore them, instead considering only the envelope function of $\chi(t)$, which is the Rotative Wave Approximation {\it cite Allen Eberli}

\subsection{Determination of electric fields}
The evolution of \cref{eq:liouville} necessarily produces radiation as the quantum dot absorbs and re-radiates light.
Using the rotating-frame density matrix detailed above, we may similarly define a rotating-frame polarization as
\begin{equation}
  \vb{P}_\text{rot}(\vb{r}, t) \equiv \sum_i 2\vb{d}_i \rho_{i_{01}}^\text{rot}(t) \delta(\vb{r} - \vb{r}_i)
  \label{eq:polarization}
\end{equation}
for a set of dots each having a location $\vb{r}_i$, dipole moment $\vb{d}_i$, and off-diagonal rotating-frame matrix element $\rho_{i_{01}}(t)$.
From this we may compute the slowly-varying electric field envelope at any other point in space via
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    & \vb{E}_\text{rot}(\vb{r}, t) = \vb{E}_0^\text{rot}(\vb{r}, t) - \frac{\varepsilon_0}{4\pi} \int \dd[3]{\vb{r}'} \\
    & \qty(I - \bar{\vb{r}}\bar{\vb{r}}) \frac{\ddot{\vb{P}}_\text{rot}(\vb{r}', t_R) + 2 i \omega_L \dot{\vb{P}}_\text{rot}(\vb{r}', t_R) - \omega_L^2 \vb{P}_\text{rot}(\vb{r}', t_R)}{c^2 \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'} e^{-i \omega_L \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}/c}} + \\
    & \qty(I - 3\bar{\vb{r}}\bar{\vb{r}}) \frac{\ddot{\vb{P}}_\text{rot}(\vb{r}', t_R) + i \omega_L \vb{P}_\text{rot}(\vb{r}', t_R)}{c \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}^2 e^{-i \omega_L \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}/c}} + \\
    & \qty(I - 3\bar{\vb{r}}\bar{\vb{r}}) \frac{\vb{P}_\text{rot}(\vb{r}', t_R)}{\abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}^3 e^{-i \omega_L \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}/c}}
  \label{eq:efield}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{\vb{r}} = \vb{r} - \vb{r}'/\abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}$ and $t_R = t - \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}/c$.
\Cref{eq:efield} arises from a rotating-frame transformation of the dyadic electric-field Green's function, again assuming a sinusoidal dependence in $\vb{P}$ and ignoring highly oscillatory components after frequency-shifting by $\omega_L$.

\section{Solution Methodology and Results}
The rotating wave approximation introduced in \cref{eq:rotating liouville} reduces the computational cost of our active media model dramatically, though constructing an appropriate solution scheme still requires some care.
To solve both \cref{eq:rotating liouville} and \cref{eq:efield} simultaneously we must first choose an appropriate discretization for $\hat{\rho}$ in both space and time.
As stated, delta functions discretize the polarization in space due to the point-like size of a dot relative to $\omega_0/c$, while we make use of an interpolatory polynomial basis set to represent the density matrix (and thereby the polarization) in time.
Such a polynomial representation then allows for easy evaluation of the retarded $\vb{P}(t_R)$, $\dot{\vb{P}}(t_R)$, and $\ddot{\vb{P}}(t_R)$ quantities that appear in \cref{eq:efield}.

This discretization, then, suggests a straightforward solution scheme in two iterated steps:
\begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item use \cref{eq:efield} to evaluate $\vb{E}_\text{rot}$ from a given source distribution at the location of each dot and \label{enum:step 1}
  \item update the source distribution by evolving \cref{eq:rotating liouville}. \label{enum:step 2}
\end{inparaenum}
The evaluation of \cref{eq:efield} proceeds straightforwardly save for pre-calculating the spatial terms and interpolation weights prior to evolving anything in time.
To evolve \cref{eq:rotating liouville}, we make use of a highly-tuned predictor/corrector ($PE(CE)^m$) algorithm detailed in \cite{Glaser2009}.
By approximating the solution to the differential equation as a weighted set of (complex) exponentials,

  Immersed in a ``$\pi$-pulse'' designed to excite a single quantum dot from $\ket{0}$ to $\ket{1}$ ($\rho_{00} = 1$ to $\rho_{00} = 0$, a rotation of $\pi$ radians around the Bloch sphere), the interaction between between two dots gives rise to a significant screening effect at short distances.
  Here, $\rho_{00}$ does not approach zero asymptotically at large separation values due to the action of the dissipator in \cref{eq:liouville}.
