\begin{abstract}
Here we consider a disordered system of interacting quantum dots---nanoscale semiconductors with wide applicability in systems ranging from lasing to quantum computing to biological contrast imaging and next-generation displays.
Quantum dots facilitate absorptive and emissive processes at specific frequencies over timescales independent of those in the incident radiation; by treating the system \emph{semiclassically} we maintain the discrete dynamics inherent to quantum objects without resorting to second quantization to describe electromagnetic fields (i.e.\ fields behave classically).
Our solution to the coupled system proceeds via
  \begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
  \item determination of source wavefunctions through evolution of the differential Liouville equations, and \label{enum:step 1}
  \item evaluation of radiation patterns through well-known computational electromagnetics techniques. \label{enum:step 2}
  \end{inparaenum}
We employ a highly-tuned predictor-corrector integration scheme to advance the source wavefunctions in time; the polarizations that arise then serve as sources within the time domain integral equations that we use to propagate the field.
This coupled solution produces a complete description of both the quantum and electromagnetic dynamics at each timestep which gives rise to lasing effects, non-linear propagation, coupled Rabi oscillations, and other optical phenomena.
This paper presents the theory, computational framework, and interesting physical observations for several such systems.

\section{Introduction}
Conventional models of electromagnetic systems produce well-understood radiation and scattering effects through standard boundary conditions, though they fail to account for richer behavior in systems with dynamics.
Analytic methods to describe these dynamics employ ensemble-averaged single-particle Green's functions styled after those used in electronic transport theories.
While such methods have proven remarkably descriptive in describing ordered environments, they break down in the presence of disorder or partial order that often occurs in actual devices thus motivating the need for a full-wave framework to describe the dynamics of interacting quantum dots.
Current full-wave solution strategies often resort to finite-difference or other mesh-based strategies\cite{Vanneste2001, Fratalocchi2008} for propagating fields throughout the simulation domain---techniques undermined by their computational overhead and numerical sensitivities\cite{Baczewski2013}.
Here, we turn our attention to an integral approach that facilitates fast and accurate field calculations by allowing direct communication of field quantities between quantum dots.


\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{The quantum Liouville-von Neumann equation}
We wish to model the behavior of $N$ interacting quantum dots immersed in a homogeneous background medium amidst monochromatic radiation of frequency $\omega_L$. Due to the band limit of the incident radiation, we approximate each quantum dot as a two-level system with transition frequency $\omega_0 \approx \omega_L$.
A density matrix formulation fully describes the time-evolution of the population in each level and evolves according to the Liouville-von Neumann equation
\begin{equation}
  i \hbar \pdv{\hat{\rho}}{t} = \commutator{\hat{\mathcal{H}}(t)}{\hat{\rho}} - \hat{\mathcal{D}}\qty[\hat{\rho}]
  \label{eq:liouville}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\mathcal{H}}$ and $\hat{\mathcal{D}}$ denote the quantum dot's Hamiltonian and dissipator operators, respectively\cite{Breuer2002}.
Here, $\hat{\mathcal{H}}(t)$ describes the  two-level structure of the dot as well as an explicit coupling to an external electric field while $\hat{\mathcal{D}}$ models the aggregate effect of processes that destroy coherences and relax populations in the quantum dot system (such as spontaneous emission or phonon losses) through assumed interactions with an external environment.
As matrices,
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{align}
    \hat{\mathcal{H}}(t) &\equiv \mqty(0 & \hbar \chi(t) \\ \hbar \chi^*(t) & \hbar \omega_0) \label{eq:hamiltonian} \\
    \hat{\mathcal{D}}[\hat{\rho}] &\equiv \mqty((\rho_{00} + 1)/T_2 & \rho_{01}/T_1 \\ \rho_{10}/T_1 & \rho_{11}/T_2) \label{eq:dissipator}
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\chi(t) \equiv \vb{d} \cdot \vb{E}/\hbar$, $\vb{d} \equiv \matrixel{0}{\hat{\vb{d}}}{1}$, $\hat{\vb{d}}$ represents the dipole moment operator $\hat{\vb{d}} \equiv -e \hat{\vb{r}}$, and $T_{1,2}$ denote characteristic relaxation times (determined empirically).
Physically, $\chi(t)$ should contain $\hat{\vb{E}}$ as an \emph{operator} to couple the quantum dot to a quantized electric field of photons; by considering systems with a sufficiently high field intensity so as to ignore single-photon effects, however, we instead treat $\vb{E}$ as a classical object arising from conventional electromagnetic source distributions in a manner consistent with the semiclassical nature of our approach.

\subsection{Determination of electric fields}

The evolution of \cref{eq:liouville} necessarily produces radiation as the quantum dot absorbs and re-radiates light.
Using the density matrix formulation detailed above, we may define a classical polarization as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \vb{P}(\vb{r}, t) &\equiv \sum_i \Tr[\hat{\vb{d}}_i \hat{\rho}_i(t)] \delta(\vb{r} - \vb{r}_i) \\
                      &\equiv \sum_i 2 \vb{d}_i \Re\!\qty[\rho_{01}^{(i)}(t)] \delta(\vb{r} - \vb{r}_i)
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:polarization}
\end{equation}
for a set of dots each having a location $\vb{r}_i$, dipole moment $\vb{d}_i$, and off-diagonal matrix element $\rho_{01}^{(i)}(t)$.
From this we may compute the electric field at any other point in space via the the electric dyadic Green's function\cite{Rothwell2008}
\begin{gather}
    \vb{E}(\vb{r}, t) = \vb{E}_0(\vb{r}, t) - \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \int
      \qty(I - 3\bar{\vb{r}}\bar{\vb{r}}) \frac{c^2 \vb{P}(\vb{r}', t_R)}{\abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}^3} + \nonumber \\
      \qty(I - 3\bar{\vb{r}}\bar{\vb{r}}) \frac{c \dot{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}', t_R)}{\abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}^2} +
      \qty(I -  \bar{\vb{r}}\bar{\vb{r}}) \frac{\ddot{\vb{P}}(\vb{r}', t_R)}{\abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}} \dd[3]{\vb{r}'}
  \label{eq:efield}
\end{gather}
where $\bar{\vb{r}} \equiv \vb{r} - \vb{r}'/\abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}$ and $t_R \equiv t - \abs{\vb{r} - \vb{r}'}/c$.
These fields serve to couple the dynamics of each quantum dot through the definition of $\chi(t)$ in \cref{eq:hamiltonian}, though this coupling introduces significant non-linearities to the system as $\hat{\rho}_i$ implicitly depends on itself arbitrarily far into the past through its interaction with other particles.

\section{Solution Methodology}
\subsection{Discretization and time-evolution}

To solve both \cref{eq:liouville,eq:efield} simultaneously we must first choose an appropriate discretization for $\hat{\rho}$ in both space and time.
As the physical dimensions of these nanostructures remain negligible when compared to the wavelengths present in radiated fields, we approximate each quantum dot as a localized $\delta$-function in space.
To represent the temporal part of $\hat{\rho}$ we make use of an interpolatory set of backward looking Lagrange polynomials.
Such a set has two advantages: it easily accounts for non-integer delay times in $t_R$ by interpolating $\vb{P}(\vb{r}, t)$ between timepoints and it facilitates straightforward evaluation of the polarization derivatives in \cref{eq:efield}.

This discretization, then, suggests a solution methodology to solve this non-linear equation in two iterated steps. We first use \cref{eq:efield} to evaluate $\vb{E}(\vb{r}, t)$ from a given source distribution at the location of each dot and then step \cref{eq:rotating liouville} forward in time to update the source distribution.
Evaluating \cref{eq:efield} proceeds straightforwardly save for pre-calculating the spatial terms and interpolation weights at the start of the simulation.
To numerically integrate \cref{eq:liouville} we make use of the highly-tuned predictor/corrector algorithm detailed in \cite{Glaser2009}.
By approximating the solution to \cref{eq:liouville} as a weighted set of (complex) exponentials, we recover the oscillating and decaying modes in $\hat{\rho}(t)$ with a high degree of accuracy.
%Moreover, repeated iterations of the corrector-evaluator step ($CE^m$) facilitate mutual interactions of quantum dots within one timestep; as a result, the timestep becomes unconstrained by delay between quantum dots and we need only consider the frequencies in the system in choosing $\Delta t$.

\subsection{The global rotating-wave approximation}
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \input{figures/frame_comparison.tex}
  \caption{\label{fig:frame comparison}
    Comparison of $\rho_{00}(t)$ using both fixed (59959 timesteps) and rotating (160 timesteps) reference frames for interacting quantum dots.
    Both frames produce largely the same trajectory, however the inset spy reveals the fixed frame contains a minute oscilliatory term that the rotating frame does not.
  }
\end{figure}

%In single-dot system where one seeks to describe $\hat{\rho}(t)$ in response to an incident pulse, this computational bottleneck is overcome by using a rotating wave approximation.
%When one is aggregating response due to multiple interactions, the computational infrastructure is more complex.
The nonlinearities inherent in coupling \cref{eq:liouville} between dots places significant constraints on $\Delta t$.
As one must choose $\Delta t < \min(\xi \omega_0^{-1}, \Delta r_\text{min}/c)$ (where $\xi$ denotes an oversampling factor) to resolve both the frequency content of \cref{eq:liouville} as well as the interference phenomena arising from \cref{eq:efield} in the nonlinear system, this scheme results in an infeasible number of time steps for the systems we wish to investigate.

Introducing a time-dependent unitary transformation, $\hat{\rho}_\text{rot} = \hat{U}\hat{\rho}\hat{U}^\dagger$, where $\hat{U} \equiv \text{diag}(1, e^{i \omega_L t})$,
we may write a rotating version of \cref{eq:liouville} as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    i \hbar \pdv{\hat{\rho}_\text{rot}}{t} &= \commutator{\hat{U} \hat{\mathcal{H}} \hat{U}^\dagger - i \hbar \hat{U} \, \partial_t \hat{U}^\dagger}{\hat{\rho}_\text{rot}} - \hat{\mathcal{D}}[\hat{\rho}_\text{rot}] \\
    &= \commutator{\mqty(0 & \hbar \chi(t)e^{-i \omega_L t} \\ \hbar \chi^*(t) e^{i \omega_L t} & \hbar\qty(\omega_0 - \omega_L))}{\hat{\rho}_\text{rot}} - \hat{\mathcal{D}}[\hat{\rho}_\text{rot}]
  \end{aligned}
  \label{eq:rotating liouville}
\end{equation}
with $\hat{U} \hat{\mathcal{H}} \hat{U}^\dagger - \hat{U} \, \partial_t \hat{U}^\dagger \equiv \hat{\mathcal{H}}_\text{rot}$.
We may similarly construct rotating-frame equivalents of \cref{eq:polarization,eq:efield} from the off-diagonal elements of \cref{eq:rotating liouville}.
The resulting equations (not shown) shift the phase relationship between particles from a time-delay to an explicit $e^{-i \omega_L \Delta r_{ij}/c}$ factor; if $\chi(t)$ contains a slowly-varying envelope modulated by a sinusoid at frequency $\omega_0$ then \cref{eq:rotating liouville} (and the resulting radiation) will contain only terms proportional to $\omega_0 \pm \omega_L$.
Over the timescales required to advance the radiation dynamics significantly, the integral of the high frequency terms becomes vanishingly small and we may safely ignore them thereby maintaining interference phenomena but \emph{greatly} reducing the frequency content of the sources.
This eliminates the timestep constraint mentioned previously and we may instead choose $\Delta t \propto (\omega_0 - \omega_L)^{-1}$ (roughly a thousand times larger than $\omega_L^{-1}$).
This shift then forms the basis of a global rotating-wave approximation for the system as a whole\cite{Allen1987}.

    Each column---shaded by the relative density of points---depicts one simulation for a given pulse intensity and each point within a column represents the excitation level, $\rho_{00}$, of a single dot.
    The horizontal variation within a column has no meaning other than to distinguish individual points, and the red circles outline the ``idealized'' population for a system without interactions.

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

  \input{figures/screening.tex}
  \caption{\label{fig:screening} Screening effect in a two-dot system.
    For the same incident pulse, quantum dots nearby each other experience very little excitation.
  }
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:frame comparison} details the trajectory of a quantum dot in an $n=32$ particle simulation under the effects of an external ``$\pi$-pulse'' (a pulse constructed to rotate a wavefunction by $\pi$ radians on the Bloch sphere) in fixed and rotating reference frames.
The fixed-frame solution contains an extra high-frequency oscillating term; on timescales significant to the evolution of $\rho_{00}$ this oscillation all but completely vanishes.

\Cref{fig:echo} shows the results of a two-pulse experiment.
Two pulses delayed by $\tau$ strike a collection of 64 nearly resonant quantum dots.
As each dot has a slightly different value of $\omega_0$, the initial pulse dephases the system by evolving the $\hat{\rho}$ at slightly different rates.
The second pulse undoes the dephasing to produce a detectable flash at time $t = 2\tau$.

Finally, \cref{fig:decoherence} depicts the population distribution for $128$ homogeneous quantum dots after exposure to a variety of incident pulses.
The integrated pulse angle (analogous to the $\pi$-pulse mentioned earlier) quantifies the intensity of the incident light.
The variation in $\vb{E}(\vb{r}, t)$ due to the interactions within the system results in a similar variation in $\rho_{00}^{(i)}$ (as compared to the curve outlined in red for a system without interactions).
Additionally, \cref{fig:screening} gives some explanation of the extreme outliers that appear in several of the columns in \cref{fig:decoherence}.
A system evolved with two dots very close to each other has very little change in the overall population though the effect diminishes rapidly with distance.
The outliers in \cref{fig:decoherence} have a small separation relative to the rest of the distribution, thus they see an effect similar to that of \cref{fig:screening} (though we note the effect becomes much more complex than simply screening an external field for many-body systems).


\section{Conclusions}
Here we have developed the tools required for a simulation of optically-active quantum dots.
In describing the coupling between particles, a semiclassical formulation offers a highly accurate integral equation methodology for propagating radiation throughout the system.
Additionally, a global rotating-wave approximation \emph{dramatically} reduces the frequency content of the systems under consideration which allows for timesteps far larger than those available in a fixed-frame model.
We have shown the numerical validity of such an approximation as well as several features of results obtained with our model.
In the near future, we hope to expand our research efforts in this area to include accelerated solvers for rotating-frame systems as well as localization phenomena arising from disorder.
